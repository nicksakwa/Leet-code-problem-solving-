## 📝 Learning Philosophy

For every problem, I aim for more than just a "Pass":

1. **Understand:** Break down the constraints and edge cases.
2. **Brute Force:** Write the initial solution to ensure logic is sound.
3. **Optimize:** Refine for better Time () and Space complexity.
4. **Document:** Briefly explain the "Aha!" moment in the solution notes.
